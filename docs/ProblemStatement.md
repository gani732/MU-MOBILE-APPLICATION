# Problem Statement

## Overview
Mahindra University, located in Hyderabad, requires a mobile application to enhance communication and safety between students, parents, and faculty members. After conducting interviews with 50+ stakeholders (students, parents, and faculty) in January 2024, we identified critical gaps in the current communication system. The existing email-based and WhatsApp group-based communication methods lack real-time tracking capabilities, efficient announcement distribution, and a unified platform for university-related information.

## Problem Description
1. **Communication Gap**
   - No centralized platform for university announcements, leading to missed deadlines and events
   - Delayed information dissemination through multiple WhatsApp groups
   - Inefficient parent-faculty communication, especially for international students' parents
   - Current system requires manual tracking of message delivery and read receipts

2. **Safety Concerns**
   - No real-time tracking of student locations, particularly during campus events
   - Delayed response to emergencies due to manual location reporting
   - Limited visibility for parents, especially during late-night events
   - Current system relies on manual attendance and location reporting

3. **Information Management**
   - Scattered university information across multiple platforms (website, emails, WhatsApp)
   - Inefficient course and event management leading to scheduling conflicts
   - Lack of real-time updates for important announcements
   - Difficulty in maintaining historical records of communications

## Objectives
1. Develop a secure mobile application for Mahindra University with role-based access
2. Implement real-time location tracking for student safety with geofencing capabilities
3. Create an efficient announcement and notification system with read receipts
4. Provide a user-friendly interface for all stakeholders with offline capabilities
5. Ensure data security and privacy compliance with GDPR and Indian data protection laws

## Scope
The application will serve:
- Students (undergraduate and postgraduate)
- Parents (including international parents)
- Faculty members (academic and administrative)
- University administration (including department heads)

## Constraints
1. Must comply with data protection regulations (GDPR, Indian Data Protection Bill)
2. Should work on both Android and iOS platforms (targeting Android 8.0+ and iOS 12+)
3. Must maintain high performance with real-time updates (target response time < 2 seconds)
4. Should be scalable for future enhancements (supporting 5000+ concurrent users)
5. Must work with limited internet connectivity (offline mode support)
6. Should integrate with existing university systems (ERP, LMS)
